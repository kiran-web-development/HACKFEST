# Hackfest Pitch Script: EcoPantry

**Time Limit: 2 Minutes**

## Intro (0:00 - 0:30)
"Good [morning/afternoon] judges. Did you know that one-third of all food produced globally is wasted? That's not just money down the drain; it's a massive environmental crisis.

Meet **EcoPantry**—the intelligent food management platform designed to close the loop on food waste for households, restaurants, and retailers."

## The Problem & Solution (0:30 - 1:00)
"Current solutions are fragmented. You have inventory apps, donation apps, and waste trackers, but nothing connects them. 

EcoPantry unifies the entire lifecycle:
1.  **Smart Pantry**: We track inventory specifically to prevent expiry.
2.  **Waste Logging**: When food *is* tossed, we track the financial and carbon impact, making the invisible cost visible.
3.  **Action**: Most importantly, we act. Before food expires, our marketplace connects donors with local communities instantly."

## Demo Highlights (1:00 - 1:45)
*[Show the App]*
"Let's see it in action. 
-   Here in the **Dashboard**, a restaurant manager sees they are wasting $400/week on prep waste. 
-   They switch to the **Pantry** view, see ingredients expiring in 2 days.
-   Instead of tossing them, they click **'Donate'**.
-   Instantly, that food is live on our **Marketplace** for a local shelter to claim.
-   We even support **Offline Mode** via PWA, crucial for detailed inventory checks in walk-in freezers with poor signal."

## Closing (1:45 - 2:00)
"We built EcoPantry with React and Tailwind to be fast, scalable, and responsive. It's not just an app; it's a tool to save money and save the planet.

Thank you! We're ready for your questions."
